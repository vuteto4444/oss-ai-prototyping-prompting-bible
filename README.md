# AI Prototyping Prompting Bible (Community Edition)

A practical, opinionated playbook for writing prompts that reliably produce better outcomes in **Lovable, Figma Make, and other AI Prototyping tools**.

## What this is
The **AI Prototyping Prompting Bible** is a team-friendly reference of proven prompting patterns: how to structure requests, control scope, debug faster, and avoid “rewrite loops” and brittle changes. It includes reusable templates for starting projects, UI-only edits, refactors, Stripe setup, automation flows, and structured debugging—usable across **Lovable, Figma Make, and other AI Prototyping tools**.

## Who this is for
- Product managers, founders, designers, and builders using **Lovable, Figma Make, and other AI Prototyping tools**
- Teams that want consistent results across contributors (shared standards, less trial-and-error)
- Anyone who wants prompts that produce **concrete fixes** (code or precise steps), not vague advice

## How it helps
- **Higher-quality outputs** through prompt structure, constraints, and step-by-step execution
- **Faster debugging** with repeatable investigation flows and “golden prompts”
- **Safer edits** via file locking guidance, minimal diffs, and “delicate update” guardrails
- **Better UX by default** with mobile-first principles and standard breakpoints
- **Reusable knowledge** by turning debug sessions into future prompts (reverse meta prompting)

## How to use it
- Treat the “TL;DR Operating Principles” as defaults for every prompt.
- Start new builds with the “Starting a New Project” template.
- For issues, use “Chat mode” patterns to analyze first, then switch to edits.
- When something breaks, use the debugging flow and save the final working prompt for reuse.
- **Create a custom GPT (or any equivalent assistant) and feed it this Bible** so it becomes your *prompting copilot*: you describe what you want to build or fix, and it generates a structured, tool-ready prompt for **Lovable, Figma Make, and other AI Prototyping tools** (including guardrails like scope, constraints, mobile-first, and minimal diffs).

## Open Source & Community Maintained
This project is **open-source** and intended to be improved by the community. Contributions are welcome—new templates, better examples, clearer structure, and tool-agnostic best practices.

- Want to help? Open an issue or submit a PR with improvements, new prompt patterns, or real-world examples.
- Maintainers will review changes, but direction is community-driven.
